The entire design is a revision of project 1 rearranged into a more compact format on a PCB
  Contains 7 Segment display, 2 buzzers, 8 leds with 4 red and 4 blue, and a joystick
All components are placed on the top mianly because the input and the output of the game should be on the same side (dispaly, leds, joystick) and there were space for the buzzers and the pocketbeagel to fit without issues.
