The prgram, J.py, is the final verion of the DDR styled game. It does not work. 
However, the intended idea is that the user can use the joystick to select the tempo they want to play the game at, and after pressing the joystick the game will start. 
Once the game starts, the two columns of LEDs will "drop" one light per beat, and the user is expected to follow the beat provided by the buzzer and input a direction at the correct time based on the LED patterns. 
The display will track the score and add 5 points whenever a corect input is detected. An error sound will play on the second buzzer whenever an expected input is missed. 
Long pressing the joystick at anytime will stopt the game and return to the bpm selection phase.
